    This program assumes that there are enough tail pages in a PageRange that the system will not overflow
        config.py -> TAIL_CONST >= 5
        
    The size of the bufferpool greatly impacts the execution speed of the program.
        config.py -> BUFFER_POOL_SIZE_RANGE (more for faster speed, less for slower speed)
